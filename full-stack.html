      <h1>The Stack is Getting Fuller</h1>
      <h3>2024-10-08</h3>

      <p>
        I have spent most of my career in tech primarily focusing on backend
        related implementations. From pioneering machine learning research on
        entity resolution to architecting massive distributed systems and
        developing cutting-edge data engineering software, my expertise has
        spanned a wide range of complex backend technologies. Recently, however,
        I have been jumping a bit into frontend development diving headfirst
        into building a full platform UI for my company as well as a "modern"
        landing page with React, Material-UI (MUI), and Tailwind CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first encounter with web development dates back to 2011 when I was
        contracted to build a company website using the inaugural release of
        Twitter Bootstrap. At the time, it felt revolutionary—a toolkit that
        simplified the creation of responsive designs without starting from
        scratch. Of course I didn't fully understand what all of that was at the
        time and the site I built looked like shit but looking back, it's
        astounding to see how far we've come. The evolution of frontend
        frameworks and tools has been nothing short of remarkable, opening up a
        world of possibilities that were once unimaginable. I want to go through
        a few things I've taken away from some of the work I've done over the
        past few weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most exhilarating aspects of frontend development is the
        instant gratification it provides. Unlike backend work, where changes
        often require complex deployments or extensive testing before results
        are visible, frontend tweaks manifest immediately. This rapid feedback
        loop is addictive. It presents a unique challenge: the constant urge to
        tweak and refine. This "tweaker's dilemma" is both a blessing and a
        curse.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been leveraging the integration of generative AI tools like
        Cursor way more in learning frontend development than I have in the
        past. It has been a crucial tool for seeing how the different components
        of a React UI interact and are structured. Being able to perform simple
        operations such as "move this button here" or "make this component
        cleaner" has freed up so much development time while tweaking the design
        of a page.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, AI tools have their limitations, particularly when it comes to
        visual design and user experience. The ability to create intuitive,
        aesthetically pleasing interfaces often requires human creativity and
        empathy—a reminder that certain aspects of design remain inherently
        human. Asking Claude to make a page more visually appealing often makes
        it uglier and less functional. Maybe design will be my next area of
        focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Frontend development presents an overwhelming array of options for
        achieving any given result. This abundance of choice is paralyzing.
        There are an insane amount of frameworks and libraries that all perform
        relatively similar outcomes. Navigating these choices has been a
        significant learning curve, especially compared to the more established
        conventions in backend development. It's a journey of continuous
        learning and adaptation. Thankfully generative AI will just choose a
        library and will often get one that works in now or two tries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UIs I’ve built recently are wild compared to the one I originally
        built almost a decade and a half ago. Instead of some poorly formatted
        bootstrap elements I now have data piping in from APIs, interactive
        WebGL objects, customizable charts/graphs, and a much better style. I'm
        not fully there yet but I can say that the road to full stack is getting
        <i>fuller</i>.
